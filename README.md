# Regression Analysis in R

## Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to regression analysis using R. It covers various regression models, including linear regression, multiple regression, and advanced techniques, to analyze and predict datasets.

## Objectives
- To explore and apply different regression techniques.
- To evaluate model performance and assess predictive accuracy.
- To preprocess data and handle various issues such as multicollinearity, outliers, and missing values.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Regression Models**: Includes multiple regression models to understand relationships between variables.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using performance metrics such as R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and others.
- **Visualizations**: Graphical representations of data and model results for better understanding.
